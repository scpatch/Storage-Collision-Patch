# Quick Start



## Examples

The examples from the case studies in our paper can be found in the examples folder, including the original and patched bytecode for Audius Governance V1/V2, Token V1/V2, xToken V1/V2, Compound III, DerivaDEX, and LoanToken. After configuring the octopus-update environment, running `python3 patch_examples.py` will generate patched contracts for each example in the related folders.
