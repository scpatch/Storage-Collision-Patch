- # Debug Tracing Tool

  This section focuses on tools and modules designed to trace, debug, and analyze the execution of Ethereum smart contracts.

  ## EVM Trace

  - **Repository**: [evm-trace](https://github.com/ApeWorX/evm-trace)
  - **Description**: A library designed for tracing Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) execution. It simplifies working with trace logs and provides structured representations of EVM execution frames.
  - **Key Features**:
    - Enables detailed inspection of smart contract execution.
    - Supports tracking storage changes, stack state, and memory during transactions.
    - Compatible with multiple Ethereum clients.
  - **Module**: `evm-trace`

  ## Octopus Updated Version

  - **Base Tool**: [octopus](https://github.com/FuzzingLabs/octopus)
  - **Description**: An extension of the original Octopus tool, updated to support new versions of smart contracts and opcode sets.
  - **Key Features**:
    - Enhances compatibility with newer Solidity versions and EVM opcode updates.
    - Adds advanced debugging and instrumentation features for smart contract analysis.
    - Provides automated instrumentation for storage-related operations (e.g., `SSTORE` and `SLOAD`).
  - **Use Cases**:
    - Security analysis of modern smart contracts.
    - Debugging upgradeable contracts and ensuring patch consistency.
  - **Module**: `octopus-update`

  

  ## Runtime Simulator

  ### Ganache

  - **Repository**: [Ganache](https://archive.trufflesuite.com/ganache/)
  - **Description**: A personal blockchain for Ethereum development, enabling fast and deterministic testing of smart contracts.
  - **Key Features**:
    - Provides a local Ethereum network with customizable settings.
    - Supports transaction tracing, gas usage analysis, and contract deployment testing.
    - Offers integration with Infura to fork the Ethereum mainnet for real-world contract testing.
  - **Use Cases**:
    - Simulating transaction execution in isolated environments.
    - Debugging and performance profiling for smart contracts.
  - **Module**: `ganache`
